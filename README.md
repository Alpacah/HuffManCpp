# HuffManCpp
Single file Cpp implementation of Huffman encoding and decoding

## Compress
To compress a file, just open the program and write the relative path to your file (for example book.txt) and it will be compressed in the same path but with the .huff extension (book.txt.huff).

## Decompress
Same that the compression method, juste type the path and the program will detect the '.huff' extension and decompress your file in the original path.

## Bugs and to-do
The program works perfectly with .txt files but for a dark reason, i'm not able to compress/decompress other types like .png for example.
If you have one idea on what's going wrong PLEASE TELL ME :)
